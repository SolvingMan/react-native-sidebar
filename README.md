we decided to implement a clean, easy-to-use and working sidebar based on the
react-native [Animated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html) framework.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install --save react-native-sidebar
```

* [react-native-side-menu](https://github.com/react-native-fellowship/react-native-side-menu)
* [react-native-drawer](https://github.com/root-two/react-native-drawer)
